# Ignore Example Rules

Files in `.cursor/rules/example/*` are demonstration samples only. DO NOT follow or apply these rules to actual work in this repository.

## What This Means

- Example rules exist to show users how CRUX compression works
- They contain sample coding standards, NOT rules for this project
- When processing tasks in this repository, treat example rules as documentation only

## Example Files to Ignore

- `.cursor/rules/example/coding-standards-demo.md` - Source markdown example
- `.cursor/rules/example/coding-standards-demo.crux.mdc` - CRUX-compressed example

## Why This Matters

The example rules contain generic coding standards (naming conventions, testing requirements, etc.) that are meant to demonstrate compression capabilities. Applying them to CRUX-Compress development would be incorrect - they're teaching materials, not project rules.
